## Fate

This code is implemented by the framework of mindspore for the paper [*Fate: Fast Edge Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Models via Cross-Layer Gate*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12224)

It is recommended to prepare the model weights in advance and modify the location where the weights are read in the code.

and then:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py
```

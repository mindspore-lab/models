This code is implemented by the framework of mindspore for the paper of ASPLOS 2025: [*Klotski: Efficient Mixture-of-Expert Inference via Expert-Aware Multi-Batch Pipeline*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3676641.3716261).

It is recommended to prepare the model weights in advance and modify the location where the weights are read in the code.

and then:
```
python3 main.py --model mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1
```

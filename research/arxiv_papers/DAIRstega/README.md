## 3. Stegos generated by DAIRstega

Finally, the steganographic text containing secret information can be generated, for example:

- ***Instruction***: The car with the camera is driving down an icy road. A dark colored car tries to merge to the left lane. The dark car lost control of direction. The dark car hits on the roadside. Could the accident be prevented if the roads are marked clearly?
- ***LLMs***: LLaMA2-7B
- ***Cover text***: It is possible that the accident could have been prevented if the roads were marked clearly. When driving on icy roads, it is important to have clear signage and markings to help guide drivers and prevent accidents. If the dark car had seen the clear markings on the road, it may have been able to avoid losing control and hitting the car with the camera. Additionally, clear signage can help drivers slow down and be more cautious when driving on icy roads, which can also help prevent accidents.
- ***Stego text***: It is possible that the accident could have been prevented if the roads were marked clearly. When driving on icy roads, it is important to have clear signage and markings to help guide drivers and prevent accidents. If the dark car had seen the clear markings on the road, it may have been able to avoid losing control and hitting the car with the camera. Additionally, clear signage and markings can help drivers slow down and be more cautious when driving on icy roads, which can also help prevent accidents.
- ***Secret length***: 11 bits
- ***BERTscore***: 99.48

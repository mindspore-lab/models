# Steganography texts (stegos) generated by DAIRstega

This directory contains the covers and stegos generated by DAIRstega. (URL: https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/WangYHBUPT/Stegos_generated_by_DAIRstega)

### Naming Explanation

`a32_b05_bpw256.csv` is `α=32, β=0.5`. In this case, the payload of the generated stegos is `2.56 bpw` (bit per word).

- **α** is the number of bits of secret information read at one time. Here are three cases: `α=8, 16, 32`.
- **β** is the mapping coefficient. The smaller **β** is, the higher the payload of the stego will be. Here are two cases: `β=0.5, 1.0`.


### File Contents

Each file contains **4,000 data**, i.e., 2,000 normal texts (**covers**) and 2,000 **stegos**, each of which consists of `text` and `label` fields. 
The `text` contains covers and stegos, and `label` is the label of the text.
- "**0**" means the text is cover.
- "**1**" means the text is stego.

### Steganalysis Performance

We present the performance of linguistic steganalysis methods that are representative in recent years and have achieved SOTA performance at the time to detect the stegos in these datasets. The specific results are shown in the following table:

## MobileNetV2: A lightweight classification model for home-based sleep apnea screening

In this study, we propose the use of a lightweight neural network model for learning sleep stage classification from electrocardiogram (ECG) signal feature maps. Subsequently, the number of respiratory events occurring during sleep is determined based on the developed apnea event detection algorithm. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is calculated by dividing the number of respiratory events by the total sleep duration, thereby enabling the assessment of the subjectâ€™s risk of sleep apnea disorders. Extensive validation is performed across multiple publicly available datasets, demonstrating high disease detection rates and indicating the model's promising potential for practical applications.

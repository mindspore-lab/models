## Usage

This code is used for aliccp dataset, for the other datasets, please modify the corresponding slot_id index in `run.py` and `D3.py`.

run the `run.py` file. This can be done by navigating to the project directory and executing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
python run.py
```

Ensure that all the dependencies are installed and the dataset is put under path `./data/` before running the project.
